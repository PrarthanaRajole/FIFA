- **Overview**:
  - The prediction system is designed to forecast the winner of a FIFA match by considering input factors such as year, team names, the referee and stadium.

- **Machine Learning Implementation**:
  - **Algorithms Used**:
    - The project utilized different machine learning techniques, including Decision Trees and Random Forest.
  - **Model Performance**:
    - The Random Forest model performed the best keeping all parameters in mind, achieving an accuracy rate of 77.38%.
  
- **Model Training and Data Handling**:
  - The project involved:
    - Preprocessing the data by selecting relevant features such as team names, referees, and stadiums.
    - Encoding categorical data using Label Encoding.
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
  
- **Model Storage**:
  - The trained models and encoders were saved as `.pickle` and `.joblib` files for future use.

- **HTML PAGE**:
  - Header: Displays the title, logo, and navigation links.
  - Prediction Form: Users can input match details to predict the winner.
  - Video Section: Features a video of the best FIFA moments.
  - Gallery: Showcases team images with captions.
  - Most Wins Table: Lists teams with the most World Cup victories.

- **Result Page**:
  - The result page of the website displays the predicted winner of the match.

Overall, this project provides an engaging platform for users to predict FIFA match outcomes, backed by robust machine learning models.
